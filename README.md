# HighFrequency_Inverter
This inverter is designed for efficient heating of non-ferromagnetic vessels, ideal for induction cooking applications. Key features include:

- **IR2110:** High and low side driver for efficient switching of MOSFETs.
- **IRF540:** Power MOSFETs for reliable and high-efficiency operation.
- **6N135 Optocoupler:** Ensures safe electrical isolation between the control and power circuits.
- **STM32 Control:** Can be connected via header pins for PWM signal input, allowing precise control over the heating process.
